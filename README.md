# Dumbassembler: We use dumbass hoomans to run assembly instructions!

Who needs Apple Silicon when we have Dumbass(TM) Hoomans??

Since CPU instructions are simple arithmetic operations that a 9 year old kid can understand, we use Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) API to let real humans perform the CPU instructions! ðŸ’¯

We also use captchas to let unsuspecting users perform the computation for us, free of charge!

Why be afraid of computers replacing humans, when **humans can replace mechanical and quantum computer?** We can create 500,000,000,000,000,000 jobs by the end of 2020, one person for a couple thousand of CPU instructions!

## This is how Skynet begins.
