# Dumbassembler: We use dumbass hoomans to run assembly instructions!

Who needs Apple Silicon when we have Dumbass(TM) Hoomans??

Since CPU instructions are simple arithmetic operations that a 9 year old kid can understand, we use Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) API to let real humans perform the CPU instructions! ðŸ’¯

We also use captchas to let unsuspecting users perform the computation for us, free of charge!

## This is how Skynet begins.
